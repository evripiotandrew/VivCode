# VivCode
VivCode is an automation utility that seamlessly integrates Visual Studio Code with Xilinx Vivado, enabling FPGA developers to write, manage, and simulate HDL code entirely within their preferred code editor. By leveraging VSCode tasks and TCL scripting, it eliminates the manual setup typically required for Vivado simulations, automatically triggering them and opening simulation GUIs for rapid design validation. This streamlined workflow enhances productivity by bridging coding and simulation environments into a single efficient interface.
